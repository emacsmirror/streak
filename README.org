* Installation

*Note: this package requires at least Emacs 27.1*

** Melpa

You can install =streak= in the usual way:

#+begin_example
M-x package-install RET streak
#+end_example

And configure it like so:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package streak
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

** Doom Emacs

Place the following in your =packages.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(package! streak)
#+end_src

This should automatically pull =streak= from Melpa. Now make sure to run =doom sync
-u=. Then in your =config.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! streak
  :config
  (streak-mode))
#+end_src

This will start =streak-mode= when Doom opens.

* Usage

** Your First Streak

=streak-mode= stores your data in its "streak file". This file will be created
automatically the first time a streak is made with =streak-new=:

#+begin_example
M-x streak-new
#+end_example

You'll be asked to name your streak. You can keep this simple (a single word)
since this label won't appear as-is in your modeline. How the modeline actually
appears can be fully customized by you (see below).

Once you've started your streak, it will increment (in the mode line)
automatically day by day.

** Manual Streak Tweaking

Consider these functions for manual control over the specific streak values:

+ =streak-reset=: Reset a streak, with "now" as the new starting point.
+ =streak-increment=: Increase a streak by 24 hours worth.
+ =streak-decrement=: The opposite of the above.
+ =streak-update=: Reread the streak file and manually update the mode line.
+ =streak-remove=: Remove a streak that you no longer want to track.

* Customization

The following aspects of =streak= can be customized (all found under the =streak=
customization group):

+ ~streak-file~: A filepath to the "streak file" where your records are kept.
+ ~streak-formatters~: An =alist= of functions to customize how each streak is
  formatted. The key of each pair must be a string that matches a streak name
  found in your streak file, while the value must be a function that accepts the
  days of that streak and returns a string.

 #+begin_src elisp
(setq streak-formatters '(("study" . (lambda (days) (format "Study: %d Days" days)))
                          ("running" . (lambda (days) (format "Run: %d Days" days)))))
 #+end_src

So a full Doom config would look like:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! streak
  :config
  (setq streak-formatters '(("study" . (lambda (days) (format "Study: %d Days" days)))
                            ("running" . (lambda (days) (format "Run: %d Days" days)))))
  (streak-mode))
#+end_src

** =all-the-icons=

TODO (Feel free to PR a working setup!)

* FAQ

** How is this different from =org-habit=?

=org-habit= is useful for tracking repeated tasks/events that occur over an
interval, like "Vaccuum every Saturday". =streak= on the other hand is for
maintaining a daily streak of some initiative you're pursuing, like "Study
German every day" or "Stop eating ice cream". Further, =streak= shows you your
current record in the mode line, thus visible at all times to keep up your
motivation.
