* Installation

*Note: this package requires at least Emacs 27.1*

** Melpa

You can install =streak= in the usual way:

#+begin_example
M-x package-install RET streak
#+end_example

And configure it like so:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package streak
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

** Doom Emacs

Place the following in your =packages.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(package! streak
  :recipe (:host github :repo "fosskers/streak"))
#+end_src

And make sure to run =doom sync -u=. Then in your =config.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'streak)
(streak-mode)
#+end_src

This will start =streak-mode= upon startup.

* Usage

=streak-mode= will automatically initialize the "streak file" the first time it is
ran. Once you've started a streak, it will increment (in the mode line)
automatically day by day.

Otherwise, consider these functions for more manual control:

+ =streak-reset=: Reset your streak, with "now" as the new starting point.
+ =streak-increment=: Increase your streak by 24 hours worth.
+ =streak-decrement=: The opposite of the above.
+ =streak-update=: Reread the streak file and manually update the mode line.

* Customization

The following aspects of =streak= can be customized (all found under the =streak=
customization group):

+ ~streak-file~: A filepath to the "streak file" where your records are kept.
+ ~streak-hour-pattern~: A format string (think ~printf~) for displaying your streak by hours. Only applies on the first day.
+ ~streak-day-pattern~: A format string for displaying your streak in days.

* FAQ

** How is this different from =org-habit=?

=org-habit= is useful for tracking repeated tasks/events that occur over an
interval, like "Vaccuum every Saturday". =streak= on the other hand is for
maintaining a daily streak of some initiative you're pursuing, like "Study
German every day" or "Stop eating ice cream". Further, =streak= shows you your
current record in the mode line, thus visible at all times to keep up your
motivation.
